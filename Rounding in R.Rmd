```{r}
# Default rounding

# From -5 to 5 at intervals of 0.25, print the number and the rounded number
for(i in seq(from = -5, to = 5, by = 0.25)){
  print(paste("The number is:", i, "   Rounded:", round(i)))

```{r}
# Traditional Rounding
# Note there are several other packages that have a round2 function that does traditional rounding
# numform was chosen because it offers many numerical formatting functions
install.packages("numform")

# From -5 to 5 at intervals of 0.25, print the number and the rounded number
for(i in seq(from = -5, to = 5, by = 0.25)){
  print(paste("The number is:", i, "   Rounded:", numform::round2(i)))
